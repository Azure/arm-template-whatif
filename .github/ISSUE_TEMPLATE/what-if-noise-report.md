## Describe the noise

**Resource type** (i.e. Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts)

**apiVersion** (i.e. 2019-04-01)

**Client (PowerShell, Azure CLI, or API)**

**Relevant ARM Template code (we only need the resource object for the above `resourceType` and `apiVersion`, but if it's easier you can include the entire template**

**Expected response (i.e. "I expected no noise since the template has not been modified since the resources were deployed)**

**Current (noisy) response (either include a screenshot of the what-if output, or copy/paste the text)**



**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
