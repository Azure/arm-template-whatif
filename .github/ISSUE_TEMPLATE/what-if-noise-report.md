**Describe the noise**
Please include the following info:
1. Resource type (i.e. Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts)
1. apiVersion (i.e. 2019-04-01)
1. Client (PowerShell, Azure CLI, API)
1. Relevant ARM Template code (we only need the resource object specified in #1 and #2, but if it's easier you can include the entire template
1. Expected response (i.e. "I expected no noise since the template has not been modified since the resources were deployed)
1. Current (noisy) response (either include a screenshot of the what-if output, or copy/paste the text)
